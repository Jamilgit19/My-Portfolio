# Resume File Instructions

## 📄 Add Your Resume Here

To enable the resume download functionality on your portfolio:

1. **Add your resume PDF** to this folder (`public/`)
2. **Name it**: `resume.pdf`
3. The download button is already configured in the hero section

## Current Setup

- **Download Link**: `/resume.pdf`
- **Download Filename**: `MD_Jamil_Resume.pdf` (the name users will see when downloading)
- **Button Location**: Hero section, between "Get In Touch" and "GitHub" buttons

## Styling
The Resume button has:
- Primary color background with 10% opacity
- Hover effect that fills with primary color
- Download icon from Lucide React
- Scale and shadow animations
- Matches the overall design system

Once you add `resume.pdf` to the public folder, the download will work automatically!
